# Namaskaram🙏, I'm [Anshuman Mishra](https://shivance.github.io)

* 👷‍♂️ I am working at [FlipAI](https://flip.ai) as a Machine Learning Engineer.
* 💻 In 2023, I have contributed to [keras-team/keras-nlp](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-nlp) extensively. I was also involved with development of Keras3. 
* 🤔 Currently my open source contributions are on a halt, as I haven't found a suitable project to contribute yet.
* 📣 I am a Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning (GenAI).
* 🌱 I'm currently learning about Large Language Models.
* 👬 I would love to collaborate on interesting NLP and implementations of Deep Learning Research Papers (if I have the bandwidth).
* 📲 You can reach me at shivanshuman021@gmail.com or on my social media profiles.
